# Code2vec

**Abstract:** This paper presents an evaluation of the code
representation model Code2vec when trained on
the task of detecting security vulnerabilities in
C source code. We leverage the open-source library astminer to extract path-contexts from the
abstract syntax trees of a corpus of labeled C
functions. Code2vec is trained on the resulting
path-contexts with the task of classifying a function as vulnerable or non-vulnerable. Using the
CodeXGLUE benchmark, we show that the accuracy of Code2vec for this task is comparable
to simple transformer-based methods such as pretrained RoBERTa, and outperforms more naive
NLP-based methods. We achieved an accuracy
of 61.43% while maintaining low computational
requirements relative to larger models.
